# Task: Write a Python program that reads a text file named numbers.txt that contains 20 integers. The program will create two other text file; 
  # the first text file will be named even.txt that will contains all even numbers extracted from the numbers.txt. The second text file will be 
  # named odd.txt that will contains all odd numbers extracted from the numbers.txt.
# Welcome the user to the program
